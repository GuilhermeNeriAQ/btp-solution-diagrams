A BTP solution diagram illustrates the architecture and elements of
a solution developed using SAP Business Technology Platform.
It demonstrates how various services and technologies within the
platform are employed to meet distinct business needs.
Each BTP solution diagram offers a visual outline of the
total solution configuration and its operational flow.
